# Heat-Map
# This is an experimental program.
# Currently it is running on a localhost MAMP server. To function, the source code in stable_2 would have to be added to the htdocs folder of a similar environment.
# The Graphs.html code uses RGraph (https://github.com/seeslab/rgraph).
# Most programs in this repo use the CodeHS Javascript library (see script tags in the source code)
